We'll be able to choose between the small (**117M** parameters) , medium (**345M** parameters), large (**774M** parameters) and XL versions (**1.5B** parameters) version of GPT-2.  \n",

By using just this data it achieved state-of-the-art scores on a number of unseen language tests, an achievement known as *zero-shot learning.* It can also perform other writing-related tasks, like translating text from one language to another, summarizing long articles, and answering trivia questions.\n"

Occasionally he would go up to watch the little dog, who used to pull the bellows that made the noise that made the bellows spin. He was always attracted to the sound of the bellows, and he would stand watching at a distance beneath the casket, gazing at the dog. When the bellows stopped he would turn to the other end of the cellar, and wait. He could hear the bellows rattling and the dog turning at one end of the cellar. The girl who kept the bellows had evidently been out and about most of the day and night, and might have noticed him, for she saw him standing in the cellar. John Wilmot came in contact with Mary's body the next morning. He was at first very feeble, his legs and arms having been paralyzed, and his speech a halting imitation. But he soon recovered — he was able to answer the question, \"Where is the doll of the dead girl which I was looking over?\" Later, when he became strong, he was able to speak and form correct sentences. He seemed to trust Mary's ghost, and he often put his hand in the casket for a moment, and noticed that she came out of it and went back into the old casket. He said she was a little bit prettier and gayer than the doll he gave to the other girl. The girl's name was Susan, and she lived at Ramsgate. The neighbors from the time of the death of John Wilmot seemed not entirely puzzled at, the strange phenomenon, but some called forth strange, almost scientific, reports from the neighbours a few days after the first witnesses. Dr. A. H. White and Mrs. J. C. Linton came down to talk over the matter with Mrs. Wilmot, who had confessed her son and daughter's deaths without any difficulty to the doctors. The girl's lips were swollen, and her hair fell about her shoulders, but there was no permanent change in her countenance, and no sign of any change in her mind. Dr. White asked her to turn to him in the corner upstairs, and when she did this a voice, a deep, low, and tremulous one, came into the room. She told the doctor that she had seen things but that it was in a dream. \"You don't suppose there is a kind of mind in the other world that comes into the world, and puts on a mask and\n",

It is his parting word, when he tells 'the Doctor' that the boys are both safe in the farmhouse. Nothing cannot be more agreeable than Ravensworth to those spirits. But the boy loves to go down by the pond, when the lake is in its sereneest twilight; and, as the moon is rising, he always climbs to the lake by the dam when the rays penetrate the low clouds, and looks down over the black waters, where, in the still shade, the melancholy shadows rise along the banks of the precipitous cliff. But when he tells his father that he wants to go on the adventures of the boyhood, and that he is going to hunt deer, the boy's face lights up with such a glorious prospect on this lovely day; and the lad bursts out laughing, and the father starts up in such a manner as if stricken with laughter himself. At first this scene appears so far different from the others in the story—it being one of them which ends with a conclusion full of tragic dejection, and a deep misery of hopelessness; but, as the spirit of the play flows in this passage, it slowly awakens the sense that all this, at bottom, is only a plot for laughter in the boy's heart: so, with the aid of a light, my imaginary friend, I proceed.

            "Model prompt >>> ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between humans and machines, Eliza simulated conversation by using a \"pattern matching\" and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no built in framework for contextualizing events. Directives on how to interact were provided by \"scripts\", written originally in MAD-Slip, which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist (in particular, Carl Rogers, who was well-known for simply parroting back at patients what they would just said), and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test. Q: What programming language was ELIZA written in?

He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He bought the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants in 1996, and sold it in 2015. Trump and his businesses have been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies.
